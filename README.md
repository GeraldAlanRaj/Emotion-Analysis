# Emotion Classification using RNN (LSTM)

This project implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using **LSTM** to classify text into one of six emotions:

- **Joy**
- **Sad**
- **Anger**
- **Fear**
- **Love**
- **Surprise**

## Model Architecture

- Text Preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, padding)
- Label Encoding of emotion classes
- Embedding Layer for word representations
- LSTM Layer to learn sequential patterns
- Dense Layers for classification
- Softmax Output for multi-class prediction
